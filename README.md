# legacy-arcade
Legacy arcade is my first JAVA console based application, it was the first project with multiple sub-applications that I'd built.
It has plenty of bugs and works only in command line and if the source files and resources are on the D-drive.
This is uploaded to my profile because I was nostalgic, and shouldn't be considered a measure of my skills.
I can't find the code for the application, and therefore this is not an open source project-which is also why I cant correct my mistakes and fix bugs.
If you'd still like to use this first application of mine:
1) Download the .zip file from releases.
2) Open the Programs folder and execute the GAME_HUB.jar in the  Programs folder, via command line.
3) Make sure that the folders are on a USB or disc.
