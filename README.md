# legacy-arcade
<br/>
<strong>This project is no longer under active development</strong>
<br>

- Legacy arcade is my first JAVA console based application, it was the first project with multiple sub-applications that I'd built.<br>
- It has plenty of bugs and works only in command line and if the source files and resources are on the D-drive.<br>
- This is uploaded to my profile because I was nostalgic, and shouldn't be considered a measure of my skills.<br>
- I can't find the code for the application, and therefore this is not an open source project-which is also why I can't correct my mistakes <br> and fix bugs.<br>
